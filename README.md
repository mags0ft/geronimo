# `geronimo`

Geronimo is a minimal and easy-to-learn Python library for your quick and dirty everday math calculations, especially regarding high-dimensional geometry calculations.

> The geronimo project does, contrary to my other projects, not accept any AI-generated contributions at all; please refrain from submitting vibe-coded pull requests.
> Intent of the library is to give room for some "recreational" and mindful coding, a.e. implementing math concepts or fun little optimizations.
> Thus, this project does **not** prioritize performance and does **not** encourage you to use it in production. There are many, many better alternatives for that.
